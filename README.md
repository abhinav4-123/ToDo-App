# ToDo App

This is a simple **ToDo App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows you to manage tasks by adding, deleting, and marking them as completed. The tasks are stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`, so they persist even when you refresh the page.

## Features

- Add tasks with a text input field.
- Mark tasks as completed using checkboxes.
- Delete tasks as needed.
- The tasks are saved locally in the browser, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/abhinav4-123/ToDo-App.git

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

3. Add, check off, or delete tasks as you go. Your tasks will be saved locally in your browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the app.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.
- **localStorage**: To persist data across sessions.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a better UI/UX.
- Allow users to categorize tasks.
- Add an option for syncing tasks across devices using an external storage service (e.g., Firebase).
