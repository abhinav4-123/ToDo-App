# Todo App

A simple and intuitive Todo App that allows users to add, check, and delete tasks. This app stores the tasks locally in the browser using `localStorage`, so the data persists even when the page is reloaded. It also plays a sound when a task is marked as completed.

## Features
- Add a new todo task
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Local storage support to retain tasks even after refreshing the page
- Sound effect when a task is checked

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/abhinav4-123/ToDo-App.git

Navigate to the project folder: cd ToDo-App


Open `index.html` in your browser to run the app.

## How It Works
1. **Add Task**: You can add a task by typing in the input box and pressing "Add". The task will appear in the list below.
2. **Mark Task as Completed**: Click on the checkbox next to a task. A sound will play, and the task will be marked as completed.
3. **Delete Task**: Click on the delete icon next to any task to remove it from the list.

The tasks are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, meaning they will persist even if you refresh the page.
